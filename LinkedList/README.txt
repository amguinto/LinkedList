NOTE: This is not finished yet.

This will be used to solve many LinkedList problems.

So far this can:
	- Add a node
	- Delete a node
	- Print in Traversal Order
	- Find the Middle Element
		- **NOTE: if the size of the list is even, then it will print the two middle elements in the list.
	- Finding and removing duplicates in progress.
